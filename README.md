You can select your favorite team, run the season, and view the final league table.

âœ¨ Features

20 teams play a full season (home & away fixtures).

Results are based on team strength (OVR), not just random rolls.

Final table shows: Points, Wins, Draws, Losses, Goal Difference.

Top 4 qualify for Champions League, bottom 3 are relegated.

Simple and clean Bootstrap frontend (with placeholder team logos).

Adjust team OVRs for realism.
